## About the Repository

The repository was built by me while practicing advanced Data Structures and Algorithms.
I applied new and innovative methods and put it on github to help viewers with a new approach towards data strucures.

## Tech Stack

All the data structures are implemented using C as it is one of the mode core languages.
There have been an intensive use of pointers in all the data structures.
Structures have been used as the primary abstract variable to form nodes.
